  "body": "Coming from a place where we meandered mornings and met quail, scrub jay, mockingbird, i knew coyote, like everyone else, i knew cactus, knew tumbleweed, lichen on the rocks and pill bugs beneath, rattlers sometimes, the soft smell of sage and the ferment of cactus pear.\n\nComing from this place, from a place where grass might grow greener on the other side but water was always scarce, I learned the value of silence.\n\nThe dust settled on our boots not as dirt, but as a memory of the earth we walked upon. We didn't speak much of endings then. The horizon was too wide, too open, suggesting an infinity that we naively accepted as our birthright. But looking back, perhaps the end was always written in the dry riverbeds, waiting for the rain that would eventually wash the slate clean.",

  "body": "The city breathes in Technicolor gasps,\nReflected in puddles of oil and regret.\nWe run for cover,\nNot from the water,\nBut from the truth it washes bare.\n\nStatic hums in the wires above,\nA lullaby for the restless,\nWhile the traffic lights blink red,\nStop. Stop. Stop.\nBut we keep moving.",

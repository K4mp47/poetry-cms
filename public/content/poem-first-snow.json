  "body": "A rabbit has stopped on the gravel driveway:\nimbibing the silence,\nyou stare at spruce needles:\nthere is no sound of a leaf blower.\n\nThe white blanket descends,\nnot with fury, but with a hush.\nEvery sharp edge of the world\nis softened, rounded, forgiven.\n\nBreath clouds in the air,\nephemeral ghosts of warmth,\nwhile the trees stand patient,\nwearing their new heavy coats.",

  "body": "It sat on the mantle, a wooden beast that devoured seconds and spat out hours. Tick. Tock. A heartbeat of brass and springs. My grandfather wound it every Sunday, a ritual as sacred as prayer.\n\nWhen he died, the clock stopped. Not immediately, but slowly, losing a minute here, a minute there, until it simply gave up. We tried to fix it. We brought in specialists, old men with monocles and steady hands. They oiled the gears and tightened the springs.\n\nIt would run for an hour, maybe two, and then silence would reclaim the room. It was then I understood that some things run not on mechanics, but on the connection to the hands that tend them.",

  "body": "The wagon and mule, Time and Eternity, stop to change places.\nTheir lean and slope-back shadow, my reservation.\nThe moon moves like infested flour.\nAt the river, bloody victories meet bloody massacres.\nThey tell each other about their dead.\n\nGrandmothers eat buffalo instead of hamburger.\nAfter supper, guitar chords bite through gravestone.\nThen the one grandfather interrupts, walking off with his own skull as a lantern into the polar night.\nSnowshoe hare cleans the ears of the sleeping and leaves prophetic dreams.",

  "body": "He built houses not with bricks, but with light. He studied how the morning sun hit the floorboards and how the afternoon shadows stretched across the walls. To him, a window was not just an opening, but a frame for the world outside.\n\nPeople called him eccentric. He refused to use artificial lights in his designs, insisting that a home should sleep when the sun sleeps.\n\n\"We have forgotten how to be in the dark,\" he would say. \"We have forgotten the comfort of shadows.\"",
